# Pool Table

Virtual pool table base on Three.js and physics.
Work in progress.

### To do


Try out physics engine
  https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Libraries-and-Plugins

Get selected meshes from loaded model and turn into Cannon static bodies.
  For debug: also add copies of those meshes to the scene (change its color), move it up a bit. To make sure we got the right mesh.
Change table top from plane to trimesh.
Add plane at floor level. For balls jumping over the edge and perhaps bottomless pockets.
Cannon based pool balls with texture mapping
